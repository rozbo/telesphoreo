header files for iPhone libraries
These header files are to be used with the iPhone GCC package. They are based on the iphone-dev headers and do not contain any information from Apple's iPhone SDK. As such, they are more of a temporary solution due to some irritating inaccuracies. When Apple releases their SDK from NDA, the instructions on saurik's website will be used to rebuild this package correctly.
